# Hello - CS50 Project

This is my first C program created as part of the [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) course by Harvard University.

The program asks the user for their name and then prints a personalized greeting.

## 💻 What It Does

It prompts the user:
Whats your name?

And then prints:
Hello [name]

## 📦 Files

- `hello.c`: The main C source code

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

If you're using GCC, open your terminal and run:

```bash
gcc hello.c -o hello
./hello
